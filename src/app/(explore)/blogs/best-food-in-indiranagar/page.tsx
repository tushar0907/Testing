      To all my vegetarian friends, when you have a craving for Italian food, then this is a ‘must’ place to visit. Its Roman-style pizzas are simply amazing. Thin, crisp crust with that perfect amount of sauce and cheese, pizzas here will make one forget that pizza needs to be overloaded with meat to taste well. Whether solo or catching up with friends, their pizzas are light and super satisfying. One more thing which I liked about this restaurant was the entire overall vibe of the restaurant. The place was very lively and the waiters were extremely nice and caring.

      Whether vegan or just looking for something healthy, Copper + Clove has got you covered. Tucked away on the floor of a corporate building, this little cafe serves up healthy bowls in hues of every color imaginable, it is so bright and packed with flavor that eating clean really will feel like a treat. And if color is what you need, Copper + Clove has it with their plant-based options for a colorful, guilt-free meal. To talk a little bit about this cafe, usually this cafe is very crowded and you'll have to maybe wait a little bit before you get a seat, but when you do, you'll surely love the food. And the ambience is just perfect.

      I cannot stop talking about this cafe! New in town and already my favorite! A must try if you love pork char siu. The char is just nice on the pork, and the flavors here get you wanting for more. Oh, and get a cup of kopi to complete your lunch—must have it! This cute cafe has now been one of my premiere one-stop destinations whenever I quickly wanna run down and have a quick meal. It's just amazing and I would definitely recommend it to you.

      Well, the next one in the list is for all the Goa lovers in town. Goa is an amazing place and it has, like, the best cafes all around. And such vibe is matched by the next cafe in the list so when you are missing the Goa beaches? Klaa brings Goa to you with their mouthwateringly soft garlic poi and the best Kipka Frial that you will ever have tasted in Bengaluru. A real treat reserved for when you need that Goan comfort food.
