      Let’s dive into the heart of any good restaurant—its food. <strong>The Only Place</strong> is famous for its <strong>continental cuisine</strong>, with a focus on steaks and grilled dishes that people rave about. If it’s your first time visiting, here are a few dishes that you absolutely have to try:

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Fiery Chicken:</strong> A go-to for anyone who enjoys a little heat. This grilled chicken packs a punch and is cooked to perfection every time.</li>

      Insider Tip: Beat the Crowd!
      </h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Here’s a little heads-up: <strong>The Only Place</strong> is as popular as ever, especially around lunchtime. While we managed to grab a table before the crowd rolled in, by 1 p.m., it’s packed. So, if you don’t want to be waiting for a table, get there early.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Aim for around 12 noon, especially on weekends, to avoid the rush. But hey, even if you do end up waiting, it’s one of those spots where the food is well worth the time.

      Walking into <strong>The Only Place</strong> feels like stepping into an old friend’s home. The decor is simple yet warm, with its rustic wooden tables and an unpretentious vibe that makes you feel instantly at ease.

      The Verdict: Taste and Price
      </h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Now, let’s get down to the nitty-gritty. How does <strong>The Only Place</strong> fare in terms of taste and value for money? Well, as someone who’s been visiting for over a decade, I can say with confidence that <strong>the taste has stayed as incredible as ever</strong>. It’s still just as good as it was back in the early 2000s when I first started coming here, and according to long-time regulars, it’s been this way since day one in 1965.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      When it comes to pricing, it’s still pretty reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food and the restaurant’s long-standing reputation. On our last visit, we ordered:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
        <li>2 drinks</li>
        <li>2 steaks</li>
        <li>1 side of fries</li>
        <li>1 extra serving of mushroom sauce</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The total came to <strong>INR 1700</strong>, which, given the generous portions and top-notch quality, felt like a solid deal. For a place that’s been dishing out consistently great meals for decades, it’s a price we’re more than happy to pay now and again.
      </p>
